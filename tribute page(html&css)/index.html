    <h1>Amy Winehouse</h1>

        <div class="container">
                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Amy Jade Winehouse was born on 14 September 1983 at Chase Farm Hospital in Gordon Hill, Enfield, to Jewish parents.
                     Her father, Mitchell "Mitch" Winehouse, was a window panel installer and taxi driver; her mother, Janis Winehouse (née Seaton), was a pharmacist, who suffers from multiple sclerosis. 
                     Winehouse's ancestors were Russian Jewish and Polish Jewish immigrants to London. She had an older brother, Alex (born 1979), and the family lived in London's Southgate area, where she attended Osidge Primary School. Winehouse attended a Jewish Sunday school while she was a child.
                      During an interview following her rise to fame, she expressed her dismissal towards the school by saying that she used to beg her father to permit her not to go and that she learned nothing about being Jewish by going anyway. In the same interview, Winehouse said she only went to a synagogue once a year on Yom Kippur "out of respect".
                    Many of Winehouse's maternal uncles were professional jazz musicians. Amy's paternal grandmother, Cynthia, was a singer and dated the English jazz saxophonist Ronnie Scott. She and Amy's parents influenced Amy's interest in jazz. Her father, Mitch, often sang Frank Sinatra songs to her, and whenever she got chastised at school, she would 
                    sing "Fly Me to the Moon" before going up to the headmistress to be told off. Winehouse's parents separated when she was nine, and she lived with her mother and stayed with her father and his girlfriend in Hatfield Heath, Essex, on weekends.
                    In 1992, her grandmother Cynthia suggested that Amy attend the Susi Earnshaw Theatre School, where she went on Saturdays to further her vocal education and to learn to tap dance. She attended the school for four years and founded a short-lived rap group called Sweet 'n' Sour, with Juliette Ashby, her childhood friend, before seeking full-time 
                    training at Sylvia Young Theatre School. Several years later it was reported that Winehouse had been expelled at 14 for "not applying herself" and also for piercing her nose, but these claims were denied by Sylvia Young: "She changed schools at 15...I've heard it said she was expelled; she wasn't. I'd never have expelled Amy." Mitch Winehouse also denied the claims. She attended the Mount School, Mill Hill and the BRIT School in Selhurst, Croydon, dropping out at age 16.

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>After the release of her first jazz-influenced album, Winehouse's focus shifted to the girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s. 
                Winehouse hired New York singer Sharon Jones's longtime band, the Dap-Kings, to back her up in the studio and on tour. 
                Mitch Winehouse relates in Amy, My Daughter how fascinating watching her process was: her perfectionism in the studio and how 
                she would put what she had sung on a CD and play it in his taxi outside to know how most people would hear her music. In May 2006, 
                Winehouse's demo tracks such as "You Know I'm No Good" and "Rehab" appeared on Mark Ronson's New York radio show on East Village 
                Radio. These were some of the first new songs played on the radio after the release of "Pumps" and both were slated to appear on 
                her second album. The 11-track album, completed in five months, was produced entirely by Salaam Remi and Ronson, with the production credits 
                being split between them. Ronson said in a 2010 interview that he liked working with Winehouse because she was blunt when she did not like 
                his work. She in turn thought that when they first met, he was a sound engineer and that she was expecting an older man with a beard.

            <br />
            <p>Promotion of Back to Black soon began and, in early October 2006 Winehouse's official website was relaunched with a 
                new layout and clips of previously unreleased songs. Back to Black was released in the UK on 30 October 2006. 
                It went to number one on the UK Albums Chart for two weeks in January 2007, dropping then climbing back for several weeks 
                in February. In the US, it entered at number seven on the Billboard 200. It was the best-selling album in the UK of 2007, 
                selling 1.85 million copies over the course of the year. The first single released from the album was the Ronson-produced 
                "Rehab." The song reached the top ten in the UK and the US. Time magazine named "Rehab" the Best Song of 2007. Writer Josh 
                Tyrangiel praised Winehouse for her confidence, saying, "What she is is mouthy, funny, sultry, and quite possibly crazy" and 
                "It's impossible not to be seduced by her originality. Combine it with production by Mark Ronson that references four 
                decades worth of soul music without once ripping it off, and you've got the best song of 2007." The album's second single 
                and lead single in the US, "You Know I'm No Good," was released in January 2007 with a remix featuring rap vocals 
                by Ghostface Killah. It ultimately reached number 18 on the UK singles chart. The title track, "Back to Black," was released 
                in the UK in April 2007 and peaked at number 25, but was more successful across mainland Europe. "Tears Dry on Their Own," 
                "Love Is a Losing Game" were also released as singles, but failed to achieve the same level of success.

        <p>A deluxe edition of Back to Black was also released on 5 November 2007 in the UK.
             The bonus disc features B-sides, rare, and live tracks, as well as "Valerie." Winehouse's
              debut DVD I Told You I Was Trouble: Live in London was released the same day in the UK and 13 November in 
              the US. It includes a live set recorded at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire and a 50-minute documentary charting 
              the singer's career over the previous four years. Frank was released in the United States on 20 November 2007 to 
              positive reviews. The album debuted at number 61 on the Billboard 200 chart. In addition to her own album, 
              she collaborated with other artists on singles. Winehouse was a vocalist on the song "Valerie" on Ronson's solo 
              album Version. The song peaked at number two in the UK, upon its October single release. "Valerie" was nominated 
              for a 2008 Brit Award for "Best British Single." Her work with ex-Sugababe Mutya Buena, "B Boy Baby," was released
               on 17 December 2007. It served as the fourth single from Buena's debut album, Real Girl. Winehouse was also in talks
                of working with Missy Elliott for her album Block Party.

        <p class="container">Winehouse promoted the release of Back to Black with headline performances in late 2006, including a Little Noise Sessions charity concert at the Union Chapel in Islington, London. On 31 December 2006, Winehouse appeared on Jools Holland's Annual Hootenanny and performed a cover of Marvin Gaye's "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" along with Paul Weller and Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra. She also performed Toots and the Maytals' "Monkey Man". At his request, actor Bruce Willis introduced Winehouse before her performance of "Rehab" at the 2007 MTV Movie Awards in Universal City, California, on 3 June 2007. During the summer of 2007, she performed at various festivals, including Glastonbury Festival and Lollapalooza in Chicago.</p>

        <h2>2009 - 2011: Final projects before death</h2>
        <p>In a 2009 poll of U.S. residents conducted for VisitBritain by Harris Interactive, one-fifth of the participants indicated they had listened to Winehouse's music during the previous year. She performed with Rhythms del Mundo on their cover of the Sam Cooke song, "Cupid", for an Artists Project Earth benefit album released in July that year.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Winehouse and Ronson contributed a cover of Lesley Gore's "It's My Party" to the Quincy Jones tribute album Q Soul Bossa Nostra, released in November 2010. She had agreed to form a group with Questlove of the Roots but her problems obtaining a visa delayed their working together. Salaam Remi had already created some material with Winehouse as part of the project. According to The Times, Universal Music pressed her for new material in 2008, but as of 2 September that year she had not been near a recording studio. In late October, Winehouse's spokesman was quoted as saying that Winehouse had not been given a deadline to complete her third album, for which she was learning to play drums.</p>
        <br />
        <p>In January 2011, Winehouse played five dates in Brazil, with opening acts of Janelle Monáe and Mayer Hawthorne. The following month she cut short a performance in Dubai following booing from the audience. Winehouse was reported to be tired, distracted and "tipsy" during the performance. On 18 June 2011, Winehouse started her twelve-leg European tour in Belgrade. Local media described her performance as a scandal and disaster; she was booed off the stage due to her apparently being too drunk to perform. Serbian defence minister Dragan Sutanovac called Winehouse's performances "a huge shame and a disappointment". It was reported that she was unable to remember the city she was in, the lyrics of her songs or the names of the members of her band. The local press also claimed that Winehouse was forced to perform by her bodyguards, who did not allow her to leave the stage when she tried to do so. She then pulled out of performances in Istanbul and Athens, which had been scheduled for the following week. On 21 June, it was announced that she had cancelled all shows of her tour and would be given "as long as it takes" to sort herself out. Winehouse's last public appearance took place at Camden's Roundhouse on 20 July 2011, when she made a surprise appearance on stage to support her goddaughter, Dionne Bromfield, who was singing "Mama Said" with the Wanted. Winehouse died three days later. Her last recording was a duet with American singer Tony Bennett for his album, Duets II, released on 20 September 2011. Their single from the album, "Body and Soul", was released on 14 September 2011 on MTV and VH1 to commemorate what would have been her 28th birthday.</p>

        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>Winehouse's bodyguard said that he had arrived at her residence three days before her death and felt she had been somewhat intoxicated. He observed moderate drinking over the next few days, and said she had been "laughing, listening to music and watching TV at 2 a.m. the day of her death". At 10 a.m. BST on 23 July 2011, he observed her lying on her bed and tried unsuccessfully to rouse her. This did not raise much suspicion because she usually slept late after a night out. According to the bodyguard, shortly after 3 p.m., he checked on her again and observed her lying in the same position as before, leading to a further check, in which he concluded that she was not breathing and had no pulse; he said he called emergency services. At 3:54 p.m., two ambulances were called to Winehouse's home in Camden, London. Winehouse was pronounced dead at the scene. Shortly afterwards, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that she had died. Family and friends attended Winehouse's private funeral on 26 July 2011 at Edgwarebury Lane Cemetery in north London. Her mother and father, Janis and Mitch Winehouse, close friends Nick Grimshaw and Kelly Osbourne, producer Mark Ronson, goddaughter Dionne Bromfield and her boyfriend Reg Traviss were among those in attendance at the private service led by Rabbi Frank Hellner. Her father delivered the eulogy, saying "Goodnight, my angel, sleep tight. Mummy and Daddy love you ever so much." Carole King's "So Far Away" closed the service with mourners singing along. She was later cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. The family planned to sit a two-day shiva. On 16 September 2012, Winehouse's ashes were buried alongside her grandmother's, Cynthia Levy at Edgwarebury Lane Cemetery.</p>
